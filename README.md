# Assignment Description

## Description

Problem Set 4 introduces optic flow as the problem of computing a dense
flow field where a flow field is a vector field \<u(x,y), v(x,y)>. We
discussed a standard method ---Hierarchical Lucas and Kanade ---for
computing these vectors. This assignment will have you implement methods
from simpler operations in order to understand more about array
manipulation and the math behind them. We would like you to focus on
movement in images, and frame interpolation, using concepts that you
will learn from modules 6A-6B: Optic Flow.

## Learning Objectives
-   Implement the Lucas-Kanade algorithm based on the concepts learned
    from the lectures.

-   Learn how pixel movement can be seen as flow vectors.

-   Create image resizing functions with interpolation.

-   Implement the Hierarchical Lucas-Kanade algorithm.

-   Understand the benefits of using a Pyramidal approach.

-   Understand the theory of action recognition.

## Problem Overview

### Methods to be used 

In this assignment you will be implementing the Lucas-Kanade method to
compute dense flow fields. Unlike previous problem sets, you will be
coding them without using OpenCV functions dedicated to solve this
problem.\
Consider implementing a GUI (i.e. cv2.createTrackbar) to help you in
finding the right parameters for each section.

### Rules
You may use image processing functions to find color channels, load
images, find edges (such as with Canny). Don't forget that those have a
variety of parameters and you may need to experiment with them. There
are certain functions that may not be allowed and are specified in the
assignment's autograder Ed Discussion post. Do not use OpenCV functions
for finding optic flow or resizing images.\
Refer to this problem set's autograder post for a list of banned
function calls.\
**Please do not use absolute paths in your submission code. All paths
should be relative to the submission directory. Any submissions with
absolute paths are in danger of receiving a penalty!**

# Instructions 

## Programming Instructions 

Your main programming task is to complete the api described in the file
**ps4.py**. The driver program **experiment.py** helps to illustrate the
intended use and will output the files needed for the writeup.
Additionally there is a file **ps4_test.py** that you can use to test
your implementation.

## Write-up Instructions

Create **ps4_report.pdf** - a PDF file that shows all your output for
the problem set, including images labeled appropriately (by filename,
e.g. ps4-1-a-1.png) so it is clear which section they are for and the
small number of written responses necessary to answer some of the
questions (as indicated). For a guide as to how to showcase your
results, please refer to the latex template for PS4.

## How to Submit 

Two assignments have been created on Gradescope: one for the report -
PS4_report, and the other for the code - **PS4_code**.

-   Report: the report (PDF only) must be submitted to the PS4_report
    assignment.

-   Code: all files must be submitted to the PS4_code assignment. DO NOT
    upload zipped folders or any sub-folders, please upload each file
    individually. Drag and drop all files into Gradescope.

### Notes

-   You can only submit to the autograder **10** times in an hour.
    You'll receive a message like \"You have exceeded the number of
    submissions in the last hour. Please wait for 36.0 mins before you
    submit again.\" when you exceed those 10 submissions. You'll also
    receive a message \"You can submit 8 times in the next 53.0 mins\"
    with each submission so that you may keep track of your submissions.

-   If you wish to modify the autograder functions, create a copy of
    those functions and DO NOT mess with the original function call.

**YOU MUST SUBMIT your report and code separately, i.e., two submissions
for the code and the report, respectively. Only your last submission
before the deadline will be counted for each of the code and the
report.**

# Optical Flow \[25 points\]

In this part you need to implement the basic Lucas Kanade step. You need
to create gradient images and implement the Lucas and Kanade optic flow
algorithm. Compute the gradients I_x and I_y using the Sobel
operator (see cv2.Sobel). Set the scale parameter to one eighth, ksize
to 3 and use the default border type.\
Recall that the this method solves the following:\

![image](Figures/1_equation.png)

The last component we need is I_t which is just the temporal
derivative - the difference between the image at time t+1 and t:
I_t = I(x, y, t+1) - I(x, y, t)

A weighted sum could be computed by just filtering the gradient image
(or the gradient squared or product of the two gradients) by a function
like a 5x5 or bigger (or smaller!) box filter or smoothing filter (e.g.
Gaussian) instead of actually looping. Convolution is just a normalized
sum. Additionally, think about what it means to solve for u and v in the
equation above. Treat each sum as a component in a 2x2 matrix, and what
it means when inverting that matrix. This will be very helpful in order
to optimize your code.

## 

Write a function *optic_flow_lk()* to perform the optic flow estimation.
Essentially, you solve the equation above for each pixel, producing two
displacement images U and V that are the X-axis and Y-axis displacements
respectively (u(x,y) and v(x,y)).\
Show these displacements using a vector or quiver plot, though you may
have to scale the values to see the dashes/arrows. An implementation of
this function is provided in the utility code section of experiment.py.\
For a pair of images that have a static background and a block that
presents a movement of 2 pixels to the right at the center, the ideal
result would be vector of zero-magnitude in the background and vectors
of magnitude = 2 in the center area:\

![image](Figures/1_flow.png)

Use the base image labeled as Shift0.png and find the motion that the
center block presents in the images ShiftR2.png,and ShiftR5U5.png. You
should be able to get a large majority of the vectors pointing in the
right direction.\
**Code:**

-   gradient_x(image)

-   gradient_y(image)

-   optic_flow_lk()

## 

Now try the code comparing the base image Shift0 with the remaining
images of ShiftR10, ShiftR20, and ShiftR40, respectively. Remember LK
only works for small displacements with respect to the gradients. Try
blurring your images or smoothing your results, you should be able to
get most vectors pointing in the right direction.\
**Report:** Does LK still work? Does it fall apart on any of the pairs?
Try using different parameters to get results closer to the ones above.
Describe your results and what you tried.

# Gaussian and Laplacian Pyramids \[20 points\]

Recall how a Gaussian pyramid is constructed using the REDUCE operator.
Here is the original paper that defines the REDUCE and EXPAND operators:
[Burt, P. J., and Adelson, E. H. (1983). The Laplacian Pyramid as a
Compact Image
Code](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/ud810/readings/Burt-Adelson1983Laplacian-Pyramid.pdf).
Here you will also find convolution to help you optimize your code to
interpolate the missing pixels.

## 

Write a function to implement REDUCE, and one that uses it to create a
Gaussian pyramid. Use this to produce a pyramid of 4 levels (0-3),
applying it to the first frame of DataSeq1 sequence. Here you will also
complete the function create_combined_img(\...) which will output an
image that looks like the example below. Normalize each subimage to \[0,
255\] before copying it in the output array, use the utility function
normalize_and_scale(\...).\
**Code:**

-   reduce_x(image)

-   gaussian_pyramid(image, levels)

-   create_combined_image(img_list)

**Report:** Input: **yos_img_01.png**. Output: the four images that make
up the Gaussian pyramid, side-by-side, large to small as
**ps4-2-a-1.png**; the combined image should look like:

![image](Figures/2_combined.png)

## 

Although the Lucas-Kanade method does not use the Laplacian Pyramid, you
do need to expand the warped coarser levels (more on this in a minute).
Therefore you will need to implement the EXPAND operator. Once you have
that, the Laplacian Pyramid is just some subtractions.\
Write a function to implement EXPAND. Using it, write a function to
compute the Laplacian pyramid from a given Gaussian pyramid. Apply it to
create the 4 level Laplacian pyramid for the first frame of DataSeq1
(your output will have 3 Laplacian images and 1 Gaussian image).\
**Code:**

-   expand_image(image)

-   laplacian_pyramid(g_pyr)

**Output:** - Input: **yos_img_01.png**. Output: the Laplacian pyramid
images, side-by-side, large to small (3 Laplacian images and 1 Gaussian
image), created from the first image of DataSeq1 as **ps4-2-b-1.png**

# Warping by flow \[10 points\]

The next task is is to create a warp function that uses flow vectors to
try to revert the apparent motion. This is going to be somewhat tricky.
We suggest using the test sequence or some simple motion sequence you
create where it's clear that a block is moving in a specific direction.
Consider the case where an object in an image A moves 2 pixels to the
right shown in image B. This means that a pixel in B(5,7)=A(3,7) here
the indexing uses x,y and not row, column. To warp B back to A create a
new image C, set C(x,y) to the value of B(x+2,y). C would then align
with A.\
Write a function warp() that takes as input an image (e.g. B) and the U
and V displacements, and returns a warped image C such that
C(x,y)=B(x+U(x,y),y+V(x,y)). Ideally, C should be identical to the
original image (A). Note: When writing code, be careful about x, y and
rows, columns.\
Implementation hints: - The NumPy function meshgrid() might be helpful
in creating a matrix of coordinate values, e.g.:

        A = np.zeros((4, 3)) 
        M, N = A.shape 
        X, Y = np.meshgrid(range(N), range(M)) 

This produces X and Y such that (X(x,y),Y(x,y))=(x,y). Try printing X
and Y to verify this. Now you can add displacements matrices (U,V)
directly with (X,Y) to get the resulting locations.\
Also, OpenCV has a handy remap() function that can be used to map image
values from one location to another. You simply need to provide the
image, an X map, a Y map and an interpolation method.

## 

Apply your single-level LK code to the DataSeq1 sequence (from 1 to 2
and 2 to 3). Because LK only works for small displacements, find a
Gaussian pyramid level that works the best for these. You will show the
output flow fields similar to what you did above and a warped version of
image 2 to the coordinate system of image 1. That is, Image 2 is warped
back into alignment with image 1. Do the same for images 2 and 3. Create
a GIF (http://gifmaker.me/) with these three images to verify your
results, you don't need to submit this. You will likely need to use a
coarser level in the pyramid (more blurring) to work for this one. If
you did this correctly, there should be no apparent motion. Note: For
this question you are only comparing between images at some chosen level
of the pyramid. In the next section you'll do the hierarchy.\
Once you have warped these images, you will subtract it from the
original. After normalizing and scaling the resulting array, ideal
results should be gray image with no visible edges. However with just
the single-level LK this may not be the case. Here is a sample output:\

![image](Figures/3_sample.png)

**Code:**

-   warp(image, U, V, interpolation, border_mode)

# Optical Flow with LARGE shifts \[25 Points\]

You may notice that for larger shifts, the Lucas-Kanade by itself fails
to record the movement values accurately. Implement the Hierarchical
Lucas-Kanade method to overcome this limitation. Complete this code in
the hierarchical_lk() function.\

## 

Compare this method with the single-level LK. Use the base image labeled
as Shift0.png and find the motion that the center block presents in the
images ShiftR10.png, ShiftR20.png, and ShiftR40.png. You should be able
to get better results with this method.

**Code:**

-   hierarchical_lk()

## 

Use the Urban2 images to calculate the optic flow between two images.
Warp the second image like you did in part 3. Show the flow image and
the difference between the original and the warped one. Reminder: the
difference image should have almost no visible edges.\
**Report:** - Input: **urban01.png** and **urban02.png**. Output:
**ps4-4-b-1.png** (quiver plot) **ps4-4-b-2.png** (difference image)

# Frame Interpolation \[10 Points\]

Optic flow can be used in Frame Interpolation (See Szelinski 2010
Section 8.5.1). With Optic Flow principles, we are able to (or at least
attempt to) create missing frames. Given that new images are created,
you need to obtain the dense optical flow, one vector per pixel.
Consider two frames I_0 and I_1, if the same motion estimate u_0
is obtained at location x_0 in image I_0 and is also obtained at
location x_0 + u_0 in image I_1, the flow vectors are said to be
consistent. You will assume the initial flow is the same as the
resulting flow. We can generate a third image I_t where t \in (0, 1)
which will contain a pixel value for the motion vector in question:

I_t(x_0+t*u_0) = (1-t)I_0(x_0) + t*I_1(x_0+u_0)
I_t(x_0) = I_0(x_0 - t*u_0)

## 

You will test this method using two simple images:\

![image](Figures/4_sample.png)

Now you will insert 4 new images uniformly distributed in between I0 and
I1. This means your resulting sequence of images are: I_0, I_0.2,
I_0.4, I_0.6, I_0.8, I_1 . Verify your results creating a GIF
from these six images. Create an image that contains all the images in
the sequence. Organize them in 2 rows and 3 columns. The first row will
show I_0, I_0.2, I_0.4 and the second one I_0.6, I_0.8,
I_1.\
**Report:** - Input: **Shift0.png** (I_0) and **ShiftR10.png**
(I_1). Output: **ps4-5-a-1.png**

## 

The next step is to try this method with real images. For this section,
use the files in MiniCooper, insert 4 new images (similar to part a) for
each pair of images.\
Include all images organized using the same layout as before (2 rows and
3 columns) for each image pair, i.e. (I_0, I_1), (I_1, I_2),
etc.\
Notice this method produces a great amount of artifacts in the resulting
images. Use what you have learned so far to reduce them in order to
create a smoother sequence of frames.\
**Report:**\
- Input: **mc01.png** (I_0) and **mc02.png** (I_1). Output:
**ps4-5-b-1.png**\
- Input: **mc02.png** (I_1) and **mc03.png** (I_2). Output:
**ps4-5-b-2.png**\

# Challenge Problem - \[10 Points\]

![image](Figures/6_challenge.png)

Finally, for our challenge questions, we will consider the application
of optical flow as a means of identifying specific actions. For example:
how can you tell if someone is running or walking? Obviously there are
many different ways to do classification, but here we will simply ask
that, given the motion analysis from optical flow, write an algorithm,
preferably a simple, rule-based algorithm that classifies whether each
video represents one of the three following classes:

-   Running

-   Walking

-   Clapping

Where a "1" is the class output for "running", "2" is the class output
for "walking", and "3" is the class output for clapping. The velocity
and direction information should be ample to identify each. You do not
have to be 100% correct on these videos, credit will be given for any
result that is better than random (3 or more out of 6 correct). You
don't have to use all of the frames of the video, just as many as you
need to classify the action. We will check to make sure that you aren't
using metadata, file ordering, or any other means besides optical flow
to classify the actions, and points will only be awarded if the optical
flow is the only input to the classifier.\
For reading in the video, we will use the read_video() function and pass
the output of this function to the function you will have to write:
classify_video().\
If you don't want to use your own rule-based classifier, consider using
the
[sklearn.DecisionTreeClassifier()](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html)
from Scikit-Learn, but don't spend too much time on this. This is not a
machine learning question!\

-Discussion Question: Optical flow is only one approach to activity
recognition and classification. Many modern methods do not require
optical flow at all, but simply learn to classify actions directly from
the pixels. Can you think of a situation in which calculating the
optical flow would be a vital part of action classification? What about
a situation in which optical flow might be unhelpful in action
classification?
